# SAAD-SR Dataset

This repository contains the official dataset and benchmark resources for the paper:

**SAAD-SR: A Scale-Aware Aerial Benchmark for Learning Robust Object Representations Under UAV-Induced Scale Shifts**

SAAD-SR is designed to evaluate object detection robustness in aerial scenarios with altitude-induced scale variation and environmental diversity. The dataset includes discretized UAV telemetry, multi-condition image sequences (day, night, snow, haze), and altitude-stratified annotations to support training and evaluation of altitude-aware detection models.
